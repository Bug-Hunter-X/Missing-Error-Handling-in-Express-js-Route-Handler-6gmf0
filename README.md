# Missing Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: inadequate error handling. The provided code lacks comprehensive checks for invalid input, leading to potential crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js route handler that retrieves a user based on their ID. However, it only handles the case where a user with the given ID doesn't exist. It fails to address scenarios where the ID is not a number or is out of bounds, which could lead to errors or vulnerabilities.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the route handler.  It includes comprehensive error handling for various scenarios:

* **Non-numeric IDs:** Checks if the ID is a valid number.
* **Out-of-bounds IDs:** Ensures the ID is within a valid range.
* **Missing user:** Handles cases where a user with the given ID is not found.

The solution demonstrates best practices for robust error handling in Express.js applications.
